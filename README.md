# snake-game.py
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Pygame. Let's break down the code and discuss its functionality:

Initialization:

Pygame is initialized, and necessary constants such as colors, screen dimensions, and font styles are defined.
The game window is set up with the title "Snake Game by Edureka".
Drawing Functions:

our_snake(snake_block, snake_list): Draws the snake on the screen using rectangles.
message(msg, color): Displays a message on the screen (e.g., game over message).
Game Loop (gameLoop() function):

Initializes variables for the snake's position, speed, and length.
Generates the initial position of the food randomly.
Enters the main game loop, where the following actions occur:
Event handling: Checks for user input to control the snake's movement or quit the game.
Updates the snake's position based on user input.
Handles collisions with the boundaries of the screen or the snake itself.
Checks if the snake eats the food, and if so, increases the snake's length and randomly generates a new position for the food.
Updates the display with the current state of the game.
Manages the game's frame rate using clock.tick(snake_speed).
Game Over Handling:

If the game ends (i.e., the snake collides with the boundaries or itself), it prompts the player to play again or quit.
Score Display:

Shows the player's score (length of the snake) on the screen.
Running the Game:

The gameLoop() function is called to start the game.
Overall, this Snake game implementation provides a basic gameplay experience where the player controls a snake to eat food and avoid collisions.
